  %p
    A 'runner' is a process which runs a build.
    You can setup as many runners as you need.
    %br
    Runners can be placed on separate users, servers, and even on your local machine.

  %p Each runner can be in one of the following states:
  %div
    %ul
      %li
        %span.label.label-success active
        \- runner is active and can process any new build
      %li
        %span.label.label-danger paused
        \- runner is paused and will not receive any new build

%hr

%p.lead To start serving your builds you can either add specific runners to your project or use shared runners
.row
  .col-sm-6
    = render 'specific_runners'
  .col-sm-6
    = render 'shared_runners'
